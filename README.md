# Pre-workshop setup
Please come to the precompiler prepared by following the below steps:

For this workshop, you will need a development environment set up for developing native code React Native applications.

1. Navigate to https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
2. Click "Building Projects with Native Code"
3. Select your preferred development OS and target OS. I recommend Android for Windows and iOS for macOS.
4. Follow the steps there all the way through "That's it!"

The instructions on the above website can sometimes be outdated. If you have any issues running a sample React Native application, please open an issue at https://github.com/TAGraves/production-ready-rn-codemash-2019/issues and I will try to help.

In addition, please clone this repository and run `npm install`.
